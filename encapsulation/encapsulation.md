# Encapsulation Benefits

Encapsulation provides three benefits: 

   - Clients cannot directly modify the object's variables.
   - Designer has greater freedom to evolve the implementation without breaking 
   API compatibility since implementation is hidden. 
   - The object's variables can be set by package's internal functions, so it prevents
   arbitrary assignments.
   
We usually omits redundant prefixes, such as Fetch, Get, Find, Lookup,
 and so on.
